You're so dense, light bends around you.
If you were any dumber we'd have to water you.
Hey buddy, don't let that extra chromosome bring you down :D
The IQ test only goes down to zero, but you make a really compelling case for negative numbers.
Ready to fail like your dad's condom?
I'd engage with you in a battle of wit but I can see that you are unarmed.
I’ve neither the time nor the crayons to communicate with you.
You're not nearly attractive enough to be this dumb.
If I wanted to kill myself I'd climb your ego and jump to your IQ.
Some babies were dropped on their heads but you were clearly thrown at a wall.
I can't believe that you were the sperm that won the race, and yet you’re still slow.
You'd need twice the brains to qualify as a half-wit.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, but you're just abusing the privilege.
I'm glad to see you're not letting your education get in the way of your ignorance.
I bet your brain feels good as new, seeing that you've never used it.
You’re the kind of a person someone would use as a blueprint to build an idiot.
Brains aren't everything. In your case they're nothing.
If you really spoke your mind, you'd be speechless.
You're not the dumbest person on the planet, but you sure better hope he doesn't die.
We all sprang from apes, but you didn't spring far enough.
Dumbass.
Go ahead and tell me everything you know. I've got a spare ten seconds.
The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.
If your brains were dynamite there wouldn't be enough to blow your hat off.
