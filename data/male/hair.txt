I love what you've done with your hair. How do you get it to come out of the nostrils like that?
Your hair is so greasy, that you can survive off fried chicken in a food shortage.
Nice Hair. Still styling it with a weed-whacker? 
I have seen better hair in the shower drain. 
I'm not saying your hair is bad, but my cat coughs up better looking stuff. 
Why don't you do something different with your hair? Like wash it. 
Nice hairdo. But isn't it early for Halloween? 
I like your hair. Did you butcher it yourself?
