You're impossible to underestimate.
If you were an inanimate object, you’d be a participation trophy.
You're about as useful as Ann Frank's drum set.
At Cornell University they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the Tunneling Electron Microscope. Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe. Yet, if I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in your work.
The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.
I wish you were as productive as your rectum. 
I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.
There’s no “I” in team, but there’s a “U” in cunt.
You should just do coffee runs for the office today, it’ll be the most productive thing you’ll do all week.
You should plant seeds in your keyboard so your tears will grow a garden.
You're nothing but trash. Actually, I take that back. At least trash used to be something useful.
