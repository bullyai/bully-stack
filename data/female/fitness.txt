I love how you pay to pick things up and put them back down. I actually laughed at it.
Do you actually work out at the gym? Or do you just take photos?
You can train all you want but it’s not going to make you a better person.
I hope you have leg day tomorrow. Lord knows you need it.
If I didn't know you, I wouldn't have guessed that you lifted weights.
If your calves were any smaller you’d be a flamingo. 
Leg day; something that you've never heard before.
Hope you can get a refund on that gym membership, it isn’t doing much for you.
Your delts aren't big enough; you’ll never be loved.
