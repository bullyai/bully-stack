This is why everybody talks behind your back.
People just tolerate you.
You’re impossible to underestimate.
If you were an inanimate object, you’d be a participation trophy.
I envy the people who haven’t met you.
I’d tell you to go fuck yourself, but not even you should have standards that low.
You're a complete tool but not half as useful.
You have the personality of an IKEA cupboard.
You stand pretty straight for someone without a backbone.
I'd call you a cunt but you lack warmth and depth.
The better part of you ran down the crack of your mama's ass.
I've insulted better people.
God ruined a perfectly good asshole by putting teeth in your mouth.
Were you born a cunt, or is it something you have to recommit yourself to every morning?
You will never be the type of person any dog you meet thinks you are.
Your makeup has more depth than your personality.
You should put a condom on your head, cause if you're gonna act like a dick you should dress like one too.
If I wanted to hear an asshole talk I would have farted.
Talking to you is like getting a blowjob. Not the orgasm, just the mess
I shudder at the thought that you are capable of breeding. Thank goodness your personality acts as a birth control device.
Is your ass jealous of the amount of shit that just came out of your mouth?
Your gene pool could use a little chlorine.
I desire that we be better strangers.
You would make a lovely corpse
